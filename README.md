# An Online Syriac Reader and Translation Tool

Gnizo ("Treasure Trove" in Syriac) is a resource to promote and maintain literacy in Classical Syriac. You can read from a variety of ancient texts, annotate and drill unknown vocabulary, and drill grammatical paradigms. A live deployment of this application lives [here](http://christian-sidak.github.io/gnizo).

The idea for Gnizo came to me over the years as I would go back to read Syriac texts, but, alas, would forget many words. I wanted a system to read a text, hover over any unknown words for a definition, then *go back* and drill all the words and conjugations I didn't know.

Currently, all study lists are cached locally, so bookmarking the page will provide your study lists with the greatest longevity. Maybe someday I will add a backend for storing user data, but it's a bit overkill at this point - Contributors? Possibly You!

Full citation and acknowledgement are pending, but a special thank you and acknowledgment in advance to George Kiraz, Syriaca.org, Srophe and Beth Mardutho for their years of contribution to Syriac scholarship and computational resources.
